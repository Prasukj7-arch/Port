## How to Run

Since this is a static HTML site, no build step is needed.

1. Clone/download the repository
2. Open `index.html` directly in any browser:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   start index.html

   # Or simply double-click index.html in File Explorer
   ```

> **Note:** Some navigation links (Resume, Contact Me) point to a sibling directory `../Capstone_Project_1/`. Make sure that project is present alongside this one for those links to work.
